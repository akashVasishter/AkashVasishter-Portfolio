            Web 3.0 also referred to as Semantic Web is a new, decentralized version of the Internet . Web 3.0 is built on the underlying layers of blockchain technology which will see the data being mainly owned and managed by internet users . First , there was Web 1.0 developed mainly by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 . Web 1.0 saw people being able to access the internet using desktop computers mainly to get information via file transfer protocol FTP. 
             Web 2.0 is a more dynamic version of the Internet and the one used widely today. <br> <img src="/images/webdef.png" alt="webtweet" style="margin-top: 1rem;margin-bottom: 1rem;"><br> <span id="dots">.....</span>. 
             
             <span id="more"> The rise of mobile devices, browsing programs, apps, and social platforms that promote interaction between users and the ability to accomplish various tasks and communication activities
            for example Web 2.0 was facilitated by tech giants like Facebook , Microsoft , Amazon and many more . The need for Web 3.0 resulted from many of these huge tech companies basically having full control over usersâ€™ ability to navigate the internet, as well as their data People will have more control over their data, as well as the ultimate power of making money from it because of the decentralized environment afforded by Web 3.0 . With Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 technologies, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) defines the layout and delivery of webpages. HTML will continue to be a foundational layer with Web 3.0, but how it connects to data sources and where those data sources will be store could be somewhat different
            Blockchain may be and example for the creation of decentralized applications and services . Cryptocurrency usage is a key feature of Web 3.0 services. Blockchain allows ownership of digital assets. This is the game-changer for finance. 
             items like assets, NFTs are located on the blockchain and could be used in many different games and they donâ€™t belong to the company. They belong to you.

         Blockchain was first proposed as a research project in 1991 , the blockchain concept was the first widespread application in use in 2009 .  As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.
            One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. 
            All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled. <span id="dots">.....</span>. 
             
             <span id="more">Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography.
                The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology DLT.
                Transactions on the blockchain network are approved by a network of thousands of computers. This removes almost all human involvement in the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information.
